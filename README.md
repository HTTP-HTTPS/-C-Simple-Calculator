# C Simple Calculator

## Description
This is a basic calculator program written in C. It supports the following operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (^)

The program takes two numbers as input and performs the selected operation. It also checks for division by zero and handles it gracefully. The user can continue performing calculations or exit the program.

## Features
- Supports multiple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- Handles division by zero error.
- Provides the option to perform multiple calculations in a loop.

## Requirements
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Standard C libraries (`stdio.h`, `math.h`)

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc calculator.c -o calculator -lm
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./calculator
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the numbers and the operation you wish to perform.

## Example
```plaintext
Enter Number1: 5
Enter Operator (+, -, *, /, ^): +
Enter Number2: 3
5 + 3 = 8

Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): y
```
